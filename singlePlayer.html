            <h1>LibraryBorn</h1>
            <p class="blurb">LibraryBorn was developed by building upon the concepts presented in Harrison Ferrone's book, "Learning C#." Ferrone's game, HeroBorn, is a simple arena game with a player, enemy, and pickups. In contrast, my version is set in a multi-floor library, featuring pickups that alter the player's size using C# scripts, colliders, and various animations.<br/>To enhance the game's audio, I utilized Audio Mixers to blend sounds and provided players with access to different audio sliders through code that persists across multiple playthroughs. Additionally, I incorporated audio and particle systems to help players locate pickups and achieve victory.<br/>To illuminate the library, I employed LightProbes, Baked Lighting, and a Post-Processing effect known as Bloom for the ceiling lights. Overall, my version of the game expands upon the original concept while incorporating unique features to create a distinctive gameplay experience.</p>

            <h2>CubeMode</h2>
            <p class="blurb">CubeMode is a game that I created by following Brackey's tutorial series titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL">How to Make a Video Game</a>. Brackey's tutorial series walks you through the process of creating a game called Cubethon, which features a course for the player to navigate while avoiding obstacles.<br/><br/>In my version of the game, I added a unique twist by making the cubes glow using a Post Processing effect called Bloom and embedding them in the ground to create a more immersive and visually appealing experience. I also incorporated a UI system to keep track of the player's score as they progress through the game, and implemented different levels to increase the game's difficulty as the player advances.</p>

            <h3>GalaxyCrashers</h3>
            <p class="blurb">GalaxyCrashers is a game that I created based on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu76c85LhGY">tutorial</a> by Jason Weimann for a game called Terrible Tweeters. Weimann's tutorial showed how to create a game similar to Angry Birds, where the player must eliminate enemies and break through obstacles. In my version of the game, I transported the gameplay to outer space and added a new level of challenge with enemy alien ships and asteroids.<br/><br/>To enhance the game's audio, I utilized Audio Mixers and allowed players to set their own audio preferences, which allowed it to persist between games. This added a level of personalization and immersion to the gameplay experience.<br/><br/>To ensure the game was visually appealing, I implemented a camera setup using a Target Group to keep the player and enemies in frame at all times, allowing for a seamless and immersive experience. </p>
