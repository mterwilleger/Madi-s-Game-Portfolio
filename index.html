            <h1>SandBattle</h1>
            <p class="blurb">My SandBattle's base game came from a tutorial from Zenva Academy found <a href="https://academy.zenva.com/course/rpg-multiplayer-projects/">here</a>. The base game spawned enemies with a loop and timer to make sure it wasn’t constantly spawning them. I used TileMap to create the map with a treasure hunt theme. As you go through the game you are collecting points, finding treasure, and destroying enemies. The game uses RPC’s to keep player and enemy health up to date. When a player reaches the “X”, it calls an RPC on everyone’s computer to end the game.</p>

            <h2>Thanksgiving</h2>
            <p class="blurb">The base of this game came from a tutorial from Zenva Academy that can be found <a href="https://academy.zenva.com/course/discover-azure-playfab-leaderboards/">here</a>. In developing this game, I implemented a leaderboard to track the time it took for players to collect all the objects. The game, made around Thanksgiving, reflects a focus on food which I thought was fitting. Each collected object contributes to the player's growth, which allows you to gather the remaining items faster. What sets this game apart is the player authentication system I created using Unity and Microsoft's PlayFab. PlayFab handles player sign-in and authentication, utilizing this information to store their time/score and rank them based on the fastest time achieved. Additionally, only the best time is saved for each player. </p>

            <h3>Capture The Flag</h3>
            <p class="blurb">My Capture the Flag game was created from a Battle Royale type game found <a href="https://academy.zenva.com/course/battle-royale-multiplayer-projects/">here</a>. In this game setup, there are two competing teams: one red and one blue. The objective is to locate the treasure box, and the team that secures it first emerges victorious. Players have the ability to shoot at enemies, causing them to flash upon successful hits. Adding to the challenge, a force field contracts at regular intervals, gradually reducing the arena's size. Remaining outside the force field results in health loss, posing a threat of elimination. The code has a good amount of logic including elements like force field management, shooting mechanics, and health tracking for an engaging gameplay experience.</p>

            <h3>HatFarm</h3>
            <p class="blurb">This game came from the game Le Chapeau which is also a Zenva Academy game. It can be found <a href="https://academy.zenva.com/course/intro-to-multiplayer-game-development/">here</a>. This game is a version of keep away. One player starts with the hat, and the other players can take it by bumping into the hatted player. There were several things that needed to be syncronized accross the players computers. The start time and who has the hat were two of the biggest things that were syncronized. We also used RPC's to keep track of the timers for each player. When the player reached the goal time, a win screen was turned on for all the players. For my game I used a farm theme. In addition to all the elements listed, I also syncronized the dropping of the fences that slowly blocked off the different areas to make the arena smaller.</p>
