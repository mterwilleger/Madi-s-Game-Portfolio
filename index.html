            <h1>LibraryBorn</h1>
            <p class="blurb">LibraryBorn was created by expanding on the ideas presented in the book titled Learning C# by Harrison Ferrone. Ferrone’s version of this game called HeroBorn is a simple arena with a player, enemy and pickups. My version is set in a Library with multiple floors, and pickups that will make you larger or smaller using C# scripts, colliders, and different Animations. I used Audio Mixers to combine sounds and exposed the Audio parameters so the Player can access the different audio sliders, and I wrote code to make those choices persist from game to game. I also implemented audio and particle systems to help the player find the different pickups and win the game. To light the Library, I used LightProbes, Baked Lighting and a Post-Processing effect called Bloom for the ceiling lights.</p>

            <h2>CubeMode</h2>
            <p class="blurb">CubeMode came from following a tutorial by Brackey’s called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL">How to Make a Video Game</a>. In this series Brackeys walks you through the steps to create a game called Cubethon. It is a simple game that has a course for the player to follow while avoiding crashing into the blocks. In my version I made the cubes glow with a Post Processing effect called Bloom, and made it so they were embedded in the ground. I used UI to keep a score of how far the player made it, and implemented different levels for when the player completed the first level.</p>

            <h3>GalaxyCrashers</h3>
            <p class="blurb">GalaxyCrashers is my version of the game Terrible Tweeters that is from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu76c85LhGY">tutorial</a> by Jason Weimann. The tutorial that I followed helped you create a game like Angry Birds. In this game the player is trying to eliminate the enemy and break through the obstacles that are in the way.  My game is set in Space, with Alien ships and asteroids to collide with. This game uses Audio Mixers, and the audio can be set by player. It saves the player’s audio preferences from game to game. The camera is set up to use a Target Group to keep the player and enemies in the camera frame at all times.</p>
